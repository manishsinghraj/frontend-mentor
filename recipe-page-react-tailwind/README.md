## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I've utilized Tailwind Directives, a new learning experience for me.

I've centralized required text contents, such as preparation time, ingredients, and instructions, into constants stored in a separate folder named constants.

I've followed a mobile-first design approach throughout the project.

Tailwind doesn't style headings by default. So, I made custom directives to style them.

Also for the table element created component directives. (index.css file)
