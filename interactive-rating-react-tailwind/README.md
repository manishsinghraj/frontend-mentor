The flip mechanism you implemented relies on several key CSS properties to create a 3D flip effect for the card. Let me break it down:

```css
@layer components {
    /* .perspective-1000 {
        perspective: 1000px;
    } */

    .flip-container {
        position: relative;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        transform-style: preserve-3d;
        transition: transform 1s;
    }

    .flip-container.flipped {
        transform: rotateY(180deg);
    }

    .flip-card,
    .flip-card-back {
        backface-visibility: hidden;
    }

    .flip-card-back {
        transform: rotateY(180deg);
    }
}

```


### Key Properties:

1. **`transform-style: preserve-3d;`**
   - This property ensures that the child elements of an element are positioned in 3D space rather than flattened into the plane of the parent element. When applied to `.flip-container`, it makes sure the `.flip-card` and `.flip-card-back` are treated as part of a 3D scene.

2. **`perspective`**
   - While not actively used in your code (you commented it out), `perspective` would typically be applied to the container to give a sense of depth. A larger value makes the 3D effect subtler, while a smaller value makes it more dramatic.

3. **`rotateY`**
   - The `rotateY(180deg)` transformation rotates an element around its vertical axis. 
   - When applied to the `.flip-container`, it flips the entire container 180 degrees, which effectively swaps the front and back cards.

4. **`backface-visibility: hidden;`**
   - This property hides the "back" side of an element when it is facing away from the user. 
   - When applied to both `.flip-card` and `.flip-card-back`, it ensures that you only see the front side of the card as it rotates. Without this, you might see a mirrored version of the card during the rotation.

5. **`.flip-container.flipped`**
   - This class applies the `rotateY(180deg)` to the container when the card should be flipped. 
   - The transition applied to `.flip-container` (with a duration of `0.6s`) makes the rotation smooth.

6. **`.flip-card` and `.flip-card-back`**
   - The `.flip-card` represents the front side of the card, and `.flip-card-back` represents the back side.
   - The `.flip-card-back` is initially rotated 180 degrees (`rotateY(180deg)`), so when the container is flipped, it comes into view.

### How It Works:

- Initially, the `.flip-container` displays the front side of the card because `.flip-card` is facing forward.
- When you click the submit button, the `handleFlip` function toggles the `isFlipped` state.
- If `isFlipped` is `true`, the `flipped` class is added to `.flip-container`, triggering the `rotateY(180deg)` transformation.
- This rotation flips the container, causing `.flip-card-back` to come into view and `.flip-card` to be hidden.

### Why the Front Card Disappears Before the Flip:
The front card might disappear momentarily before the flip if the transition timing or order of class application creates a brief state where both cards are neither fully visible nor hidden. 

### Potential Fixes:
- **Use opacity instead of `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`:** By transitioning the opacity of the front card as it flips, you can avoid the blink effect.
- **Ensure both sides are positioned correctly** with `absolute` positioning to prevent any layout shifts that might cause a flicker.



## Here's a summary of how the structure works to create the flip effect:

1. **Main Container Div**:
   - Acts as the wrapper for the front and back cards.
   - Positioned relatively (`position: relative`) to control the placement of the front and back cards within it.
   - It handles the flip animation, typically rotating on the Y-axis when the "flipped" class is added.

2. **Front Card Div**:
   - Contains the content visible by default before the flip.
   - Positioned absolutely (`position: absolute`) within the main container, allowing it to overlap perfectly with the back card.
   - It remains visible until the flip is triggered, at which point it rotates out of view.

3. **Back Card Div**:
   - Contains the content shown after the flip.
   - Also positioned absolutely within the main container, stacking on top of or behind the front card.
   - Initially rotated 180 degrees on the Y-axis (`transform: rotateY(180deg)`), so itâ€™s facing away from the user and hidden.

4. **Flip Mechanism**:
   - When the "flipped" class is added to the main container, it triggers a `rotateY(180deg)` transformation on the container.
   - The front card rotates to face away, and since `backface-visibility` is hidden, it disappears.
   - The back card, which was initially facing away, now rotates into view.
